# Contributing to org-nixos-config-public

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

MSF is an impartial, neutral and independent humanitarian organisation that provides medical assistance to people affected by conflict, epidemics, disasters, or exclusion from healthcare. As a nonprofit organization, funded almost entirely by small donations from individuals, we believe in sharing our work openly so others can benefit, learn, and improve on it.

Your ideas, bug reports, and improvements are welcome.

## Our capacity

Please note:  
- We maintain this codebase on a **best-effort basis**. Our core focus remains supporting the humanitarian work of MSF.
- Our team does **not have the resources** to provide active support, answer every issue, or review all pull requests quickly.  
- We may not be able to engage in extended discussions or guide new contributors in depth.  

That said, we‚Äôre grateful for contributions and will review them when possible.

## How you can contribute

- **Report bugs** via GitHub issues. Please include as much detail as possible.  
- **Submit pull requests** for fixes or improvements. Smaller, focused PRs are easiest for us to review.  
- **Fork the project** if you‚Äôd like to experiment or take it in new directions. At present, anyone who wants to use this code will first need to fork it, and we encourate this.

## Contribution guidelines

- Please keep changes focused and documented.  
- Please follow existing coding style and conventions where possible.  
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions. All members and partners of MSF read and agree to abide by [the MSF Behavioural Commitments](https://www.msf.org/msf-behavioural-commitments), and we ask that you read them and do likewise.
- By contributing, you agree to license your contributions under the same license as this project.

## Thank you üôè

Even if we cannot respond quickly, please know that your contributions will help make this project more useful for us and the wider community.

We appreciate your support.
